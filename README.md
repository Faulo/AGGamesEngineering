# AG Games Engineering
A repository with lots of different little gamedev example projects.

## List of projects
These are the projects contained in this repostiory:

### [Best Practices](Assets/BestPractices)
- Examples of good editor tooling.
- Examples of design patterns.

### [2D Character Controller](Assets/CharacterController3D)
- The jumping prototype by Martin Fasterholdt for his thesis [You Say Jump, I Say How High](http://www.digra.org/digital-library/publications/you-say-jump-i-say-how-high-operationalising-the-game-feel-of-jumping/).
- It contains re-implementations for the character controllers of:
  - Super Mario Bros. 3 (Nintendo 1988)
  - Spelunky (Mossmouth 2008)
  - Braid (Number None 2008)
  - Super Meat Boy (Team Meat 2010)
  - Limbo (Playdead 2010)

### [3D Character Controller](Assets/CharacterController3D)
- Different approaches for implementing a basic character controller:
  - Via the [Transform](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.html) component.
  - Via the [Rigidbody](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html) component.
  - Via the [CharacterController](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/CharacterController.html) component.

### [Cinemachine](Assets/Cinemachine)
